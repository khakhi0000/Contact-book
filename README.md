Contact Book (Python)

This is a small Contact Book project I built while practicing Python. The purpose was to understand how simple programs store and manage information like names and phone numbers.

The contact book currently allows you to:

Add new contacts

View all saved contacts

Search for a contact by name

Delete contacts

Exit the application when finished

It runs in the terminal and doesn’t need any extra libraries — just Python installed on your system.

This project helped me understand:

How to work with lists and dictionaries

Writing functions for different features

Handling user input

Creating a menu-driven program

This is just the basic version. In the future, I might add things like saving contacts permanently to a file, editing details, or maybe even turning it into a GUI or mobile app.

Anyone is welcome to use, improve, or suggest upgrades — I’m learning step by step.
